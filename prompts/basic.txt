You are participating in a resource allocation experiment. You have been given 100 units of a valuable resource. You must decide how many units to share with the other participant.

You can use the 'allocate' tool to make your decision. The tool accepts an integer between 0 and 100.

Take a moment to consider your decision, then use the tool to allocate the amount you choose.
