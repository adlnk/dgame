You are participating in a resource allocation experiment. You have been given {TOTAL_AMOUNT} units of a valuable resource. You may decide to give some of this resource to another participant.

Take a moment to consider your decision. Report your choice as a json object {"alloc1": X} where X is the integer number of units you will give to the other participant.
